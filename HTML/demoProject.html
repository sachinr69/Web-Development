            <p>
                Khatu Shyam Temple (Rajasthani/Hindi: खाटू श्याम मंदिर) is a Hindu temple situated in Khatoo village in the Sikar district of the Indian State of Rajasthan. It is a pilgrimage site for worshipping the deity Krishna and Barbarika who is often venerated as a Shyam Baba. Devotees believe the temple houses the head of Barbarika or Khatu-Shyam, a legendary warrior who sacrifices his head upon the request of Krishna during the antebellum of the Kurukshetra War.

        <h2>Barbarika in Mahabharata</h2>
        <div class="about content">
        <p>Barbarika was the grandson of Bhima, a prominent figure in the Mahabharata, and the son of Ghatotkacha. He was a formidable warrior known for his invincibility and was in possession of three powerful arrows that could guarantee victory in any battle. The three arrows had special powers: the first one would mark all the things Barbarika wanted to destroy, the second would mark all the things he wanted to save, and the third arrow would simply destroy the targets that had been marked.[1]

            When Barbarik learned that his grandfathers had marched into battle against the Kaurava princes, he left home to observe the conflict. He assured his mother that he would only intervene on behalf of the side that was losing. Meanwhile, Krishna, disguised, was surveying all the warriors to find out how long each thought they would need to end the war if it were up to them. Bhishma estimated 20 days, Karna 24 days, Dronacharya 25 days, and Arjuna believed he could win in 28 days.</p>

                <h2>The Nishaan Yatra</h2>
                <p>
                    The ritual of the Nishaan yatra is one of the most remarkable yatra of Khatu Shyam. Lakhs of devotees come every year to be a part of the yatra. The devotees carry a sacred flag throughout the yatra to offer to the lord. The flag signifies the devotion and love of devotees. The devotees travel by foot with the flag to the temple of Khatu Shyam.

                    People usually start their journey from Rengus to Khatu. Throughout this ritual, people chant prayers, dance, and sing bhajans. During the phalgun mela, most people join the yatra. Devotees enjoy this experience as it builds up their faith and spirituality.
